### Hi there, I'm Nancy Ihechu! ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about **Computational Chemistry**, **Drug Discovery**, and **Chemoinformatics**. I was fortunate to be selected for the prestigious **Erasmus Mundus double degree program** in **Chemistry** and **Chemoinformatics**, which has allowed me to explore my passion for both disciplines.

- ðŸŒŸ I successfully completed my **M1 in Chemistry** at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.
- ðŸ“š I am currently pursuing my **M2 in Chemoinformatics** at the University of Strasbourg, France.
- ðŸ’¼ Here on my GitHub, youâ€™ll find projects I've worked on during my studies, where I've gained hands-on experience in Chemoinformatics, and the exciting projects I am passionate about.

Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on new projects, especially those related to **computational drug discovery**, **molecular modeling**, and **data science**. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss ideas!
