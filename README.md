Hi there, I'm Nancy Ihechu!  

I’m a Computational Chemist passionate about drug discovery, molecular modeling, chemoinformatics and Quantum Computing. I hold an Erasmus Mundus double master’s degree in Chemistry and Chemoinformatics from the University of Ljubljana (Slovenia) and the University of Strasbourg (France).  

During the final phase of my master’s, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant focusing on computational drug discovery for Parkinson’s disease, specifically targeting the WD40 domain of LRRK2. This work involved molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to study ligand–protein interactions and guide lead optimization.  

I am currently a first-year PhD student at the University of Missouri, Columbia, where my research focuses on implementing quantum computing approaches in Health Care and Life Sciences (HCLS), applying Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) methods for drug fragment simulations.  

On my GitHub, you’ll find projects reflecting my journey in computational chemistry, quantum computing, and drug design. I’m always open to collaborations and discussions in these fields.
