Hi there, I'm Nancy Ihechu! 👋

I’m a Computational Chemist passionate about drug discovery, molecular modeling, and chemoinformatics. I hold an Erasmus Mundus double master’s degree in Chemistry and Chemoinformatics from the University of Ljubljana (Slovenia) and the University of Strasbourg (France).

Currently, I’m a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Missouri, Columbia, working on computational drug discovery for Parkinson’s disease, specifically targeting the WD40 domain of LRRK2. My work involves molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to study ligand–protein interactions and guide lead optimization.

Here on my GitHub, you’ll find projects reflecting my journey in computational chemistry and drug design. I’m always open to collaborations and discussions in these fields.
